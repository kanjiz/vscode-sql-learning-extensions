# vscode-sql-learning-extensions

This project is designed to help students learn SQL using VS Code. It provides a pre-configured `extensions.json` that suggests the installation of helpful extensions for working with SQL in VS Code.

## Recommended Extensions

We recommend the following extensions for an optimized SQL learning experience:

1. **SQLTools** - This extension offers basic features for managing SQL databases within VS Code.
  
2. **SQLTools MySQL Driver** - This driver allows SQLTools to connect to MySQL, MariaDB, and TiDB databases.

To use these extensions, simply open the project in VS Code. You will be prompted to install the recommended extensions if they have not been installed already.
